        <p>He wanted to bring his love for the game to all players! No more searching piles of paper books!
            So he founded the company in 1125 and has grown it to have over 7 billion active users. 
            That's more user than there are cards in existence!

        <p>We run charity events every year and our next stop is the Sick Kids That Love Card Games charity ball in Kansas!</p>
